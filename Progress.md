# Development Progress Tracker

## Week 1: Core Structure
### 2025-04-26
 **Completed**: Header component with responsive navigation  
 **Learned**: 
- Google Fonts implementation
- Gradient text effects using CSS
```css
.leftSideHeader span {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #140e22, #5159e2);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
}
```

### 2025-04-27
 **Completed**: Hero section with responsive image  
**Key Insight**: 
- Using `width: 100% + max-width` for responsive images prevents layout breaks
```css
.Hero__Image img {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 850px;
  height: auto;
}
```

### 2025-04-28 (midnight --> 2am)
‚úÖ **Completed**: Features and Habit Tips sections  
üîß **Technical Breakthroughs**:
1. learned responsive image techniques `width: 100% + max-width`
2. Implemented `object-fit: cover` for consistent image cropping
3. Discovered flex-wrap for mobile layouts

## Key Lessons
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Responsiveness**: Always use `width: 100%` with `max-width`
- üß© **Component Thinking**: Structured CSS for easy React conversion later

## 2025-04-28 (3:58pm)
‚úÖ **Completed**: Added a Call To Action section called CTA
‚úÖ **Completed**: Added a footer
‚úÖ **Completed**: responsive design to the landing 

## Key Lessons
- **Grid when dealing with both column and row at the same time** : `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));` this willautomatically fit as many columns as it can based on the container's width at least 250px wide, but can grow up to a flexible size (1fr) 


üîß **Technical Breakthroughs**:
1. Added the scaling effected when hovering over the HabitTips article with a little ease animation `transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;` this will tell you that when u add transform there is an animation of ease with duration of 0.3s same as box-shadow to add depth
2. concerning the responsive design on the typographie i learned that clamp is a good function that help in typographie it is modern responsive `font-size: clamp(0.875rem, 2.5vw, 1rem);`
3. Flexbox is usually used to deal with row "or" column but grid deal with both row and column `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));`

## 2025-04-29 
‚úÖ **Completed**: made the navbar responsive with the hamburger menu

üîß **Technical Breakthroughs**:
with the help JavaScript we could make it when we click on the hamburger a class of `mobile-menu` will appear and when we click again it dissapears this with the help of `classList.toggle('mobile-menu')`

## 2025-05-01
‚úÖ **Completed**:made some changes into the CSS adding `global.css` which contains Global CSS and reusable components
‚úÖ **Completed** : the authentication UI + responsiveness

## Key Lessons 
had some problem with the slider effect which was a bit difficult but i learned the way of implementing it shown in the second note of the `Technical Breakthroughs`
üîß **Technical Breakthroughs**:
1. `flex: 1` tells the element: ‚ÄúStretch in the direction of the container‚Äôs layout and fill what‚Äôs left.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to set exact widths or heights ‚Äî `flex: 1` adapts dynamically.
2. considering the slider animation of two items it is prefered to wrap the two element in a class called `slider` assign 200% width and the parent container of `slider` will take `overflow:hidden` and the `transformX` will be the key factor

## 2025-05-08

‚úÖ **Completed**: made some changes into the CSS adding global.css which contains Global CSS and reusable components
‚úÖ **Completed**: the authentication UI + responsiveness
‚úÖ **Completed**: fixed landscape layout issues on the authentication screen where form content was getting cut off on smaller height devices (e.g., 740√ó360)

## Key Lessons
While testing responsiveness, I realized that although the UI looked good on portrait view (e.g., 360√ó740), it broke in landscape view (740√ó360). The root cause was using fixed min-height values and missing height constraints on parents. I learned that vertical space is limited in landscape mode, so content must be allowed to scroll or adapt fluidly.media query to remove min-height from forms on shorter screens:
``
## üîß Technical Breakthroughs:
Fixing landscape layout issues:
Avoid setting fixed min-height values that don‚Äôt scale with screen height
Use media queries to adjust layout for smaller vertical space:
```css
@media (max-height: 500px) {
  .SignIn__Layout form,
  .Signup__Layout form {
    min-height: unset;
    height: auto;
    padding: 1rem 0;
  }
}
```
Ensure overflow-y: auto is enabled on scrollable containers
Use height: 100% or min-height: 100vh strategically to support scrolling

## 2025-05-09

‚úÖ **Completed**: Form Validation with JavaScript
‚úÖ **Completed**: during the SignUp after verification we added the user in the localStorage and verified the existance of email during signUp(u cant signup with the same email) with the help localStorage
‚úÖ **Completed**:Login Procedure
‚úÖ **Completed**:Logout Functionality
## Key Lessons
when we set the localStorage item you must JSON.stringify(data)
## 2025-05-12
‚úÖ **Completed** : Profile Edit Functionality and UI Done
## Key Lessons
when u read a data in local Storage and u want to use it's data u must wrap it inside JSON.parse() like this 
`const VariableName = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(leyName"))`
